# 💰 CashHive System

CashHive is a business expense management system developed as an **Integrative Project** in the **Software Engineering** module of the **Systems Analysis and Development** course at UniFAP. 

The project was created to help businesses register and monitor **expenses** and **revenues**, improving financial organization and decision-making.
